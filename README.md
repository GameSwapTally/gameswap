How to complile:
    Currently none of the source code is written in a language that
    requires compiling.

How to run:
    Since all components of the project are currently web-based, the code
    needs to be run on a web server such as Apache, as well as a mySQL server
    for the database.  To run this application on your machine locally, XAMPP
    is recommended.  Using phpMyAdmin you can import the included .sql file
    into a new database called 'gameswaptally_test'.  Additionally, everything
    is also hosted on our server and can be run by typing 54.209.151.46 into
    your favorite browser's address bar.

How to run the unit test cases:
